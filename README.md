# MPSVG-LogoMaker

### User Story

```md
AS a freelance web developer
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered




### Usage 

- Open the cloned repository in any source code editor e.g. Visual Studio Code.
- Open integrated terminal on index.js
- Enter “node index.js” in the command line
- Through sequential order within the command line interface the user will be - presented with npm inquirer questions  the user will provide a response to each - question and proceed.
- Once completed a SVG file named "logo.svg" will be created.
- At your discretion, you may rename the "logo.svg" file to the file name of your choice.
- (Optional) Regarding future use, you may alter the prompted questions within the index.js to best suit your needs.
- (Optional) The SVG Logo Maker serves as a foundation so you are not limited to altering the files (as you have my permission) to create the best possible "logo.svg" file.
